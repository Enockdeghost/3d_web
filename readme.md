# Simple 3D Web Application with Spline Animation

## Overview

This project is a simple 3D web application that utilizes **Spline** for animation. Spline is a 3D design tool that allows you to create and animate 3D content in the browser. It provides an intuitive way to add 3D interactions and animations to web pages.

In this project, you'll see how to integrate 3D models and animations created in Spline into a web application.

## Features

- **3D Object Rendering**: Display 3D models with animations in the browser.
- **Spline Animation Integration**: Use Spline's built-in animation system to animate objects.
- **User Interaction**: Allow users to interact with the 3D scene through mouse events.
- **Smooth Animations**: High-quality animations with smooth transitions and movement.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **3D Graphics & Animation**: Spline
- **Web Server**: Local or hosted via GitHub Pages or other web services

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Install a web browser (preferably the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, or Edge)
